# Contributing

Want to contribute to hippotable? That makes me very happy ❤️

Here's how to proceed:

1. See a rough outline of the features we'd like to add in [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) — in no particular order.
2. Please find or create an [issue](https://github.com/thoughtspile/hippotable/issues) before starting the work to make sure nobody's working on the feature already, and to get more context on the problem.
3. The changes go straight to production, so please take your time to double-check that the code works.
4. Pull requests should link to the issue (`closes #123`) and contain a brief description of the technical details of your solution.
5. I might be busy with other things. If the PR gets stuck, please ping [@thoughtspile](https://twitter.com/thoughtspile)

Looking forward to your submissions!
